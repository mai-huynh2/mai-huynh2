## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ngoc-Mai!

ðŸŽ“ Junior at Howard University, studying Computer Science
ðŸ”­ Aspiring Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer

I strive to understand the intersection of data, intelligence, and design through predictive modeling and data analysis. I'm a forever student and believe that having the audacity to put yourself in spaces that challenge you and allow you to step out of your comfrot zone will help you grow beyond what you could imagine.

Currently, I'm researching artificial reasoning, and under taht umbrella, I'm cocnentrating on figuring out how AI can understand causal relationships instead of just correlation and how we can help the machine interpretm undertsand, and infer the choices we make based off of emotions and intent.

# ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: Sentiment Analysis for American Express (*link your project README)
What We Did: Preprocessed and vectorized text data using spaCy, then built an SVM classifier to predict sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral)
Tools: Python, spaCy, scikit-learn
Result: 85% accuracy, , outperforming the baseline by 20%, and provided insights that helped guide data-driven improvements in customer service.
