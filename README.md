# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ngoc-Mai!

ðŸŽ“ Junior at Howard University, studying Computer Science
ðŸ”­ Aspiring Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer

I strive to understand the intersection of data, intelligence, and design through predictive modeling and data analysis. I'm a forever student and believe that having the audacity to put yourself in spaces that challenge you and allow you to step out of your comfrot zone will help you grow beyond what you could imagine.

Currently, I'm focusing on building machine learning models that can help me piece together insights in the finance and psychology sector. Iâ€™m looking to leverage and grow my skills in an internship where I can contribute to exciting projects and learn from industry professionals- got any leads? Let me know!

## ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: Eigenface Recognition Model
What We Did: Preprocessed grayscale face images and applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to generate Eigenfaces. Then, used a nearest neighbor classifier in the reduced eigenspace to perform facial recognition.
Tools: Python, OpenCV, NumPy, scikit-learn
Result: Achieved 78% accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction in face recognition. The model provided strong performance on a clean test set and highlighted key challenges in real-world image variation.

## ðŸš€ Projects:
Another noteworthy project Iâ€™ve worked on:
ðŸ“ˆ Apple Stock Price Predictor â€“ Time Series Forecasting with LSTM  
[View Project on GitHub](https://github.com/mai-huynh2/Stock-Prediction)
Developed a stock price prediction model using historical Apple (AAPL) stock data. Implemented Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast future closing prices based on prior trends.
Tech Stack:Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
Learnings:
- Applied time series preprocessing techniques such as normalization, sequence windowing, and reshaping for LSTM input  
- Built and trained a two-layer LSTM model with dropout regularization to prevent overfitting  
- Visualized actual vs. predicted stock prices to evaluate model effectiveness and trend accuracy

âœ¨ Fun Fact:
When I'm not coding, I day trade futures (mainly NQ to keep my stres levels high) and playing Marvel Rivals competitively (I'm in the top 2% of the player base)!

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on ...
Researching artificial reasoning, and under that umbrella, I'm cocnentrating on figuring out how AI can understand causal relationships instead of just correlation and how we can help the machine interpretm undertsand, and infer the choices we make based off of emotions and intent.
